# Asset Management System – Backend (AI-Ready Architecture)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a backend **Asset Management System** developed using **Django and Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
It enables secure and efficient asset tracking while following a **scalable, AI-ready architecture** designed for future analytics and machine learning integration.

The system exposes RESTful APIs for managing assets and users, supports secure authentication, and is deployed on the cloud with automated CI/CD.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Asset tracking and management via RESTful APIs  
- Secure authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**  
- Password recovery through **email-based verification**  
- Complete **CRUD operations** for asset records and user profiles
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Modular backend design suitable for **data analytics and AI extensions**  
- Cloud deployment with automated **CI/CD pipelines**

---

## 🧠 AI-Ready Architecture
The backend is structured to support future **Artificial Intelligence and data analytics use cases**, including:
- Collection of clean, structured data for ML pipelines  
- Easy integration of **machine learning models** (e.g., asset usage prediction, anomaly detection)  
- Data-driven system design through reusable and scalable APIs  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Django  
- **API Framework:** Django REST Framework  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **Database:** Relational Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Render (Cloud Platform)  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub-based automated deployment  

---
